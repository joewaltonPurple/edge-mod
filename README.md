# Edge Mod
Edge Mod is a Soltra Edge adapter that contains modifications and enhancements to Soltra Edge. After using Soltra Edge as our core Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Platform we found that the system could do with some tweaks in order to match our current workflow. We worked together with our partners to develop this adapter for the last year around of current requirements.

Further documentation and guidance on features provided by the adapter are detailed in the Wiki.

## Status
The adapter is still under active development and as such shouldn't be considered a finished product.

## Installation
The adapter is currently aimed at version 2.8.1 of Soltra Edge. Other versions may work but your mileage may vary. The following is carried out as a Super User on the GUI whilst on the 'Admin > Adapters' page.

1. Upload and install the new adapter
2. Click on 'Restart Services' in the 'Restart Required' box

## Upgrade
Upgrading the adapter requires a few extra steps before following the installation instructions.

1. Click the red X to the right of the 'running' status on the certuk_mod line
2. Status will change to 'removing' but may get stuck, if so refresh the page
4. Click on 'Restart Services' in the 'Restart Required' box
5. Following the installation instructions
